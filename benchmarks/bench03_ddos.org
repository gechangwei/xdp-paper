* DDOS protection test
The idea is to use one or more netperf TCP_RR flows as a baseline load, and
test what happens under DOS.

* Baseline:

- Run TCP_RR with no other load and record how many trans/sec we get. Single
  instance, up to num_cores.

* DDOS test

- From a separate source machine, run a flood attack (simple UDP is probably
  easiest), and measure its impact on the legitimate TCP_RR traffic (i.e.,
  trans/sec should go down, or be interrupted completely).

- Enable an XDP program that drops the attack packets immediately upon
  reception, and cpumap REDIRECTs everything else to a different CPU. Then
  measure TCP_RR with this enabled.

In both these cases, we probably want to scale up the attack traffic and show
performance as a function of attack volume.

We also install flow rules to redirect all traffic to a single RXQ and perform
the disambiguation there.
